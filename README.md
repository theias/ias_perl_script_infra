# Installation

## Check Out the Source

The script should run just fine if you check it out, install the dependencies in
rpm_specific (rpm systems), or deb_control (deb systems) and run it.

## Building a Package

You can build a package and install it, which will take care of the dependencies.

### Requirements

All of the requisite things can be installed via packages.

#### All Systems

* fakeroot

#### Debian

* build-essential

#### RPM Based Systems

* rpm-build

### Building a Debian package

<pre>
  fakeroot make clean install debsetup debbuild
</pre>

### Building an RPM

If you're building from a tag, and the spec file has been put
into the tag, then you can build this on any system that has
rpm building utilities installed, without fakeroot:

<pre>
make clean install cp-rpmspec rpmbuild
</pre>

Sometimes the spec file might not be checked in with the tag.

This will generate a new spec file every time:

<pre>
fakeroot make clean install rpmspec rpmbuild
</pre>
